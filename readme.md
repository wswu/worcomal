# Worcomal

Modeling compounding word formation across languages. This code accompanies our paper [Massively Translingual Compound Analysis and Translation Discovery](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1612/)


# Usage

Clone this repo and do a `pip install . -e`. I'll eventually make this a registered Python package.

Check `examples.py` for how to use this library! You can download a dictionary from [here](https://cs.jhu.edu/~winston/compounds/wiktionary.tsv.gz).


# Experiments and Demo

Check the [old repo](https://github.com/wswu/worcomal-old) (will be ported here soon).
